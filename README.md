The Library Exchange Format (LEF) and Design Exchange Format (DEF) libraries are
distributed by https://si2.org under the Apache 2.0 license, but to download
them you have to fill out a form and wait days for them to email an expiring
link. All the copies floating around on GitHub either seem to have random
modifications (like the OpenROAD ones) or are embedded in a larger repo.

So here's a clean copy of LEF/DEF 5.8_60p007 from Si2.
